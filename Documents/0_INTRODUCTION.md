Introduction
============
_Welcome to the workshop!_

The Fault, the Fix and the Flag
-------------------------------
Most sections contain three parts:
* The Fault: In this part you're introduced to a security vulnerability, and are guided through the steps needed to exploit that vulnerability on the version of Sticky Notes running on your machine.
* The Fix: In this part you'll fix the security vulnerability in Sticky Notes locally on your machine.
* The Flag: This part is optional, but if you want a challenge, you can hunt from flags using the exploit covered by the given section. You'll hunt for flags in the online version of [Notes.Client](http://sticky-notes.eu.ngrok.io/client/) and [Notes.Api](http://sticky-notes.eu.ngrok.io/swagger/index.html).
